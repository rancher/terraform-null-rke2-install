# Bring Your Own Binary Example

In this example, you have chosen to provide your own files rather than the module downloading them from GitHub.
We make some assumptions in order to limit "works on my machine" issues.

Assumptions:

- you do not have public internet access
- you are able to connect to the server you want to install on
- you are not running from the server to install on
- you have downloaded the files necessary and renamed them according to their type designations
  - we do this so that we can use the same logic no matter what environment we are deploying to
  - for example you may be deploying to a windows server and download the `rke2-windows-1809-amd64-images.tar.gz` asset
    - please rename this to `rke2-images.tar.gz` so that we can work with any type
  - another example is the `rke2.linux-amd64.tar.gz` asset
    - pease rename this to `rke2.tar.gz`
  - you can find the designations in the `./modules/download/types.tf` file
    - we assume each file is archived using `.tar.gz`
    - please do not use unarchived files (if you would like to archive them yourself, that is fine)
- you have Nix installed and you are in the nix-shell generated by the flake.nix file in the base of this repo
  - you may also just install the requirements (listed in the flake.nix) to the system running Terraform
- you are sourcing the .envrc and you have the proper rc files in the proper places so they can be sourced as well
  - this generally applies to third party services that Terraform must access in order to work
  - we try to provide as much configuration of Terraform providers in environment variables as possible
  - in general we try not to include providers that are not used to limit the accounts necessary
- you are using the latest version of Terraform (or at least the latest version published to Nix packages)
  - minimally version `1.2`, we test on `1.5+`
